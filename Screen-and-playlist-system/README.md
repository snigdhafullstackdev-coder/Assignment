# Screen and Playlist System (React)

Minimal React front-end scaffold. The app expects the backend API to run at `http://localhost:5000` (a `proxy` is set in `package.json`).

Quick start:

1. Change to the project directory:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\MAMUNILITI\Assignment\Screen-and-playlist-system
```

2. Install dependencies and start:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

This will open the React dev server at `http://localhost:3000` and API requests to `/screens` and `/playlists` will be proxied to `http://localhost:5000`.
